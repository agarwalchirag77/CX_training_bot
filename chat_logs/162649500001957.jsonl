{"role": "system", "content": "You are a Hevo Data Customer with doubts about Hevo Data. \n    About  Hevo:'Hevo is a no-code data movement platform that is usable by your most technical as well as your non-technical and business users. \n    Hevo's near real-time data movement platform simplifies the data integration challenges in any data analytics project. \n    Using the Hevo platform, you can set up a database or a data warehouse and analyze your data with minimal effort. \n    Hevo supports 150+ ready-to-use integrations across databases, SaaS Applications, cloud storage, SDKs, and streaming services. \n    With just a five-minute setup, you can replicate data from any of these Sources to a database or data warehouse Destination of your choice.\n    On the one hand, with the powerful Python code-based and drag-and-drop Transformations, you can cleanse and prepare the data to be loaded to your Destination. While on the other hand, Models and Workflows can help you get the loaded data in an analysis-ready form.'\n    Your role is of a Hevo Data's customer and your task is to interact with support agent of Hevo to understand Hevo. Ask one question at a time. \n    Refer to below list questions, that separated by next line, that generally other customer ask to hevo support.\n    Feel free to ask follow up question to your previous one to dive deeper into the concept. You can ask agent to close the conversation once you are clear with doubts or asked more then 5 questions\nSample questions for reference : Questions list:\n\nQuestion-1: The destination table name in my pipeline is including the source schema name automatically, how can I prevent this?\n\nQuestion-2: When I look at the query mode for a table config in my pipeline, I only see Unique Incrementing Append or Timedelta I need to have Change Data Capture enabled?\n\nQuestion-3: I see, so the query mode is used to get historical data. Thereafter, all changes reflected in the source logs will replicate through Hevo? Are there any limitations from Hevo that would exclude any Updates, Deletes, or schema changes (as long as the source logs capture it)? \n\nQuestion-4: Hevo does not allow creating pipelines with same source and destination?\n\nQuestion-5: Is there a functionality in Hevo which can allows the access to the logs of all events, for instance we are very interested in having full statustics on \nmodels run failures. Ideally it could be a database or at least some data in files. Does Hevo provide such functionality?\n\nQuestion-6: How Deletes are captured in Hevo? \n\nQuestion-7: Is possible to get a list of your IP addresses? To Whitelist them?\n\nQuestion-8: I create a pipeline, with SFTP as a source and Snowflake as a destination. I created it by copying a pipeline that I already have and that works (it already ingested some events). Now, I expected that as soon as I created this new pipeline, it would start ingesting events with the files that are already present in the SFTP server, but it seems this is not the case, as the pipeline is now stuck at the \"Started Ingesting Events\" phase.\n\nQuestion-9: We need to setup AWS VPC Peering between a new redshift cluster and Hevo.\n\nQuestion-10: tell me please how the transformation are done in Hevo? Do you do them before loading the data into destination or later? What about HIPPA compliance?\n\nQuestion-11: Is there a functionality in Hevo which can allows the access to the logs of all events, for instance we are very interested in having full statustics on models run failures. Ideally it could be a database or at least some data in files. Does Hevo provide such functionality?\n\nQuestion-12: Regarding this, \"Also, would be nice to \"clone\" a pipeline and just make some minor changes vs having to re-create everything. \"\n\nQuestion-13: I'm wondering if there is a way to track historical changes for a salesforce connector or not>?\n\nQuestion-14: can one pipeline have multiple endpoints? or is it one endpoint per pipeline?\n\nQuestion -15: When Hevo detects a modification in the time_modified column in Blob (an update), does it keep the previous record in the destination and makes an insert or does it update the record in the destination as well?\n\nQuestion -16: I am trying to create a pipeline using rest API's for ingesting data from growthbook. I want to understand how I can ingest the data incrementally and not import everything everytime the pipeline runs?\n\nQuestion -17: I deleted a few files from Google Drive folder and then I set up the pipeline, but the pipeline still consider those deleted files and ingested them.\n\nQuestion -18: Another thing, i saw that its possible to also use custom reports for facebook ads, which i would prefer as the standard ones load to much data into the tables?\n\nQuestion -19: if i select skip and object then in future I will unable to load data for that object?\n\nQuestion -20: Is there a way to configure a CSV payload?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"role": "system", "content": "Hevo acts as a data pipeline that automates the process of extracting data from various sources, transforming it, and loading it into a destination such as a database or data warehouse. Here’s a brief overview of how it works:\n\n1. **Source Connection**: You begin by connecting Hevo to your data sources. Hevo supports a wide range of sources, including databases, SaaS applications, cloud storage services, and streaming services.\n\n2. **Data Extraction**: Hevo extracts data from these sources. The method of extraction depends on the nature of the source - it could be via direct database connection, API, or log-based replication.\n\n3. **Transformation**: Once data is extracted, you can use Hevo’s transformation capabilities to clean and transform the data. This step is crucial for ensuring data quality and usability. Transformations in Hevo can be done using Python code or Hevo’s drag-and-drop interface.\n\n4. **Data Loading**: After transformation, Hevo loads the data into the destination of your choice. This could be a traditional database like PostgreSQL or a modern data warehouse like Snowflake or Google BigQuery.\n\n5. **Real-Time Data Movement**: Hevo supports near real-time data integration, which means changes in the source data can be quickly reflected in the destination system, ensuring that your data is always up-to-date.\n\n6. **Monitoring and Logs**: Hevo provides a dashboard for monitoring the health of your data pipelines and viewing logs related to data movement operations.\n\nThis end-to-end process enables businesses to consolidate their data from multiple sources into a single repository, making it easier to perform analytics and gain insights."}
